# ðŸš² Azure ML Regression Project: Bike Rental Demand Prediction

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a **regression model** using **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio** to predict the number of bikes rented based on various features like **date, time, weather, and season**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

To develop and deploy a machine learning model that predicts the **number of bike rentals** at different times of the day based on temporal and environmental factors.

## ðŸ§  What the Model Does

Given input features such as:
- Hour of the day
- Date
- Weather conditions
- Season
- Holiday/weekend status

The model predicts:
- Expected number of bikes to be rented

## ðŸš€ Deployment on Azure

- Platform: Azure Machine Learning Studio
- Endpoint Type: Real-time
- Provisioning: âœ… Succeeded
- Authentication: Key-based access
- Status: Live and working
